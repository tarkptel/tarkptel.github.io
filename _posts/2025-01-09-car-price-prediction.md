# 🚗 Car Price Prediction: Predicting Used Car Prices with Machine Learning  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
Buying or selling a used car can be challenging, especially when it comes to determining the right price. A car’s price depends on multiple factors such as its **brand, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and condition**.  

This project aims to solve this problem by building a **Machine Learning-powered Car Price Prediction System** that provides accurate price estimates based on historical data.  

This web-based application helps both **car buyers and sellers** make informed decisions by predicting the fair market value of a used vehicle. Instead of relying on guesswork or inconsistent price listings, users can simply enter a few details about the car and get an **instant price prediction** backed by data.

## 🏗 How Does It Work?  
The project uses **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms** to analyze past sales data and learn the pricing patterns. Here’s the complete workflow:  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning  
- I scraped a large dataset from a website using Python and Selenium. It contain features like **brand, model, manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, location, and selling price**.  
- The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing text data.  

### 2️⃣ Model Selection & Training  
- Various **regression models** were trained and tested, including:  
  - ✅ **Linear Regression** – For a simple price trend analysis.  
  - ✅ **Random Forest Regressor** – To capture complex relationships between features.  
  - ✅ **Gradient Boosting Regressor** – To improve prediction accuracy.  
- After evaluating different models, **Gradient Boosting** was chosen for deployment due to its high accuracy and stability.  

### 3️⃣ Web Application Development  
- A user-friendly web interface was built using **Flask**.  
- Users can enter car details in a simple form and instantly get a predicted price.  

### 4️⃣ Deployment  
- The model and web application were deployed on **Render** for easy access.  
- Now, users can predict car prices from any device with an internet connection.
