# 🌟 Potato Disease Classification

![Potato Disease Classification](/assets/images/pateto.png)

## 📌 Overview
The **Potato Disease Classification** project is a **deep learning-based** solution designed to **identify and classify potato leaf diseases** along with **Confidence**. Using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, this model can detect **Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves** from images.  
This project helps farmers and agricultural experts **diagnose potato plant diseases early**, leading to **better crop management and higher yields**.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Image-based Classification** – Upload a potato leaf image to detect diseases.  
✅ **Deep Learning Model** – Uses CNN for high accuracy predictions.  
✅ **Multi-class Classification** – Identifies **Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight**.  
✅ **Web App Deployment** – Deployed on **Hugging Face** for public access.  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🧠  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** 🏗️  
- **OpenCV** 📷  
- **Streamlit / Flask** 🌐 (for web app deployment)  
- **Hugging Face Spaces** 🚀  

## 🖥️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **Upload an image** of a potato leaf.  
2️⃣ The model **analyzes the image** using deep learning.  
3️⃣ It **predicts the disease category** (Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight).  
4️⃣ Users receive **disease classification results** instantly.  

## 🌍 Live Demo

## 💻 Source Code  
🔗 **GitHub Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/tarkptel/potato-disease-classification)  

## 🔬 Dataset Used  
- The dataset consists of **thousands of labeled images** of potato leaves, sourced from Kaggle and other agricultural research datasets.  


## 📢 Future Improvements  
🚀 Improve model accuracy using **Transfer Learning**.  
📊 Add an **explainability feature** (Grad-CAM) to visualize predictions.  
🌱 Expand to other **crop disease classification** models.
